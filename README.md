## Reusable Gulp Tasks

This is simply a set of gulp tasks I've built or found useful. They are all decomposed rather than being in a monolithic
gulpfile. Many of them also depend on a build configuration file. Some tasks may depend on other tasks.

This set of gulp tasks is meant to evolve over time.
